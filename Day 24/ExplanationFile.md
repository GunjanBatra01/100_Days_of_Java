### Task: 
    Given an integer, N, print its first 10 multiples. Each multiple N x i (where 1<=i<=10) should be printed on a new line in the form: N x i = result.

### Programming Language: Java

### Input:
    An integer, N

### Output: 
    Print 10 lines of output; each line i (where 1<=i<=10) contains the result of N x i in the form:
    N x i = result.

### Logic:
    1. In main function, we are creating an object of class Scanner named 'scanner' since we need to take input from user.
    2. In variable named 'n' of integer type, we are storing the input from user.
    3. 'n' depicts the number for which we need table of.
    4. In for loop, from i = 1 till i = 10 ==> Print table of n
