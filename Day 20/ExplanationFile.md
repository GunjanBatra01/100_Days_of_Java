### Task: 
Evaluate curved surface area of cylinder with a particular radius and height using aggregation.

### Programming Language: Java

### Output: 
    Curved Surface Area of cylinder with radius 5 and height 12 is: 376.8

### Logic:
    1. In class Operation, we have created a function 'evaluate' with two parameters a and b.
    2. In class Aggregation, we are creating an instance refering to the class Operation.
    3. We have created a variable named 'pi' of type double with value 3.14.
    4. Creating a method named 'curved_surface_area' with parameters radius and height.
    5. In variable named rh, we are calling evaluate method for object op which is taking radius and height as parameters.
    6. In this method, we are returning the curved surface area using formula 2*pi*rh.
    7. In main function, we are creating an object of class Aggregation named 'obj'.
    8. For this object, we are calling the method curved_surface_area with radius as 5 and height 12.
    9. Printing the value of curved surface area of cylinder is done by line 20.
