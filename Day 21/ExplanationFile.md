### Task: 
Print area of square, rectangle, triangle, and circle using a method overloading.

### Programming Language: Java

### Output: 
    Area of square with side 3.2 is: 10.240000000000002

    Area of cicle with radius 5 is: 78.5

    Area of rectangle with sides 2.3 and 1.2 is: 2.76

    Area of triangle with base 6 and height 3 is: 9.0

### Logic:
    1. In class Demo, we have four methods named 'area()' with different parameters and with different definition.
    2. First area() method, takes a parameter of type double, side a. This method calculates area of square.
    3. Second area() method, takes a parameter of type integer, radius r. This method calculates area of circle.
    4. Third area() method, takes two parameters of  type double, length and breadth. This method calculates area of rectangle.
    5. Fourth area() method, takes two parameters of type integer, base and height. This method calculates area of triangle.
    6. In main function, we are creating an object named 'obj' of class Demo.
    7. For the object obj, we are calling each area method.
