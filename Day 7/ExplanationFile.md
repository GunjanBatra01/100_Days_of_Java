### Task: 
Write a program where you run two nested for loops to print the index. You don't have to print the index when indexes of both loops are same and print rest of all.

### Programming Language: Java

### Output: 
Indexes for both loops except when they are equal.

### Logic:

==> In our program, we are using nested for loop which will iterate from i=1 to i=5

==> In nested loop, we are checking 'if' condition that if i==j, continue will get executed which will skip the current iteration of the loop. It will jump to the next iteration.

==> When i is not equals to j, the program will print the value of i and j.
