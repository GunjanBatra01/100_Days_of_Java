### Task: 
Write a function to find Fibonacci numbers one by one within a limit N. Let 2 and 3 are the initial numbers in the sequence. Print the number. Pass it to another function that checks if the number is a power of 2. If so, print the number. Create a class that has these two functions and the main() function.

### Programming Language: Java

### Input format:
  The input consists of the value n.

### Output format: 
  The output prints the Fibonacci numbers and whether the number is power of two or not. 

### Test Cases:
    Input: 5        Output: 2 is a fibonacci number 
                            2 is a power of two
                            3 is a fibonacci number 
                            5 is a fibonacci number 

    Input: 15       Output: 2 is a fibonacci number 
                            2 is a power of two
                            3 is a fibonacci number 
                            5 is a fibonacci number 
                            8 is a fibonacci number 
                            8 is a power of two
                            13 is a fibonacci number
