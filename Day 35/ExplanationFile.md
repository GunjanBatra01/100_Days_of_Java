### Task: 
Create two interfaces A and B each declaring a method. Create a class implementing both the interfaces with complete definition of each method declared in interfaces. Using object call both the methods.

### Programming Language: Java

### Input:

    String : Name = Gunjan
    String : Language = Java

### Output: 

    Gunjan Java
    Java Gunjan

### Logic:

(i) We created an interface named A in which we have initialized a String variable named "name" with the value "Gunjan".

(ii) We have also declared a String method named methodA().

(iii) Similarly, we have created another interface named B with a String variable and a String method.

(iv) Then we have constructed a class named "Join" in which we need to provide the definition of both the methods since this class implements both the interfaces.

(v) In main function, we are creating an object of class Join, using which we are calling the methods.
