### Task: 
Write a program to check whether a triangle is Equilateral, Isosceles, or Scalene.

Equilateral triangle: An equilateral triangle is a triangle in which all three sides are equal. In the familiar Euclidean geometry, equilateral triangles are also equiangular; all three internal angles are congruent to each other and are each 60Â°.

Isosceles triangle: An isosceles triangle is a triangle that has two sides of equal length.

Scalene triangle: A scalene triangle is a triangle that has three unequal sides.

### Programming Language: Java

### Input format:
    The input consists of the three sides of the triangle.

### Output format: 
    The output prints whether the triangle is Equilateral, Isosceles, or Scalene.

### Test Cases:
    Input: 60 60 60         Output: This is an equilateral triangle.

    Input: 50 50 70         Output: This is an isosceles triangle.

    Input: 80 60 70         Output: This is a scelene triangle.
