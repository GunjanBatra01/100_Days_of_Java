### Task: 
"Success Academy" has arranged for a entrance test for High School students from rural villages. Those successful students of the test will be awarded the scholarship for their IIT/JEE preparations at Success Academy. Sunil, the co-coordinator and founder of the academy has given one problem for the first stage of the test. The problem goes like this:
Given two integers x and n, find the number of ways to express x as sum of n-th powers of unique natural numbers. It is given that 1 <= n <= 20.
Sunil himself has not computed the solution of the problem. Write a recursive function to help him find the answer for the same to evaluate the students.

### Function Specifications:
Use the function return type and the argument type as:
    int countWays(int,int)
This recursive function should return the number of ways to express x as sum of n-th powers of unique natural numbers.

### Programming Language: Java

### Input format:
The first line of input contains the integer x.
The second line contains the integer n.

### Output format: 
Output the number of ways to express x as sum of n-th powers of unique natural numbers in a single line.
