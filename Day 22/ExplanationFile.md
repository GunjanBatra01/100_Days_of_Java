### Task: 
Implement method overriding through java program.

### Programming Language: Java

### Output: 
    Shape
    Shape filled with color
    Circle
    Hexagon

### Logic:
    1. In class Shape, we are creating two methods draw() and fill().
    2. In class Circle which is inheriting class Shape, also has draw() method with same signature i.e. same name and same number of parameters but since it's in another class it will be called Method Overriding.
    3. In class Hexagon which is inheriting class Shape, also has draw() method with same signature.
    4. In main function, we are creating three objects for three classes Shape, Circle, and Hexagon.
    5. For object named obj, we are calling both methods, draw() and fill() of class Shape.
    6. For object named c1, we are calling draw() method.
    7. For object named h1, we are calling draw() method.
