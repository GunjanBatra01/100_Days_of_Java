### Task: 
    The challenge here is to read n lines of input until you reach EOF, then number and print all n lines of content.

### Programming Language: Java

### Input:
    Read some unknown n lines of input from stdin(System.in) until you reach EOF; each line of input contains a non-empty String.

### Sample Input:
    Hello world
    I am a file
    Read me until end-of-file.

### Output: 
    For each line, print the line number, followed by a single space, and then the line content received as input.

### Sample Output:
    1 Hello world
    2 I am a file
    3 Read me until end-of-file

### Explanation:
    1. In computing, End Of File (commonly abbreviated EOF) is a condition in a computer operating system where no more data can be read from a data source.
    2. Java's Scanner.hasNext() method is helpful in checking if scanner has another input token or not.
